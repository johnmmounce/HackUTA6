## HackUTA6
"What's My Damage" is a debt calculator that shows users how much they need to pay monthly to be debt-free. With clear visuals and progress tracking, it's the perfect tool for financial control.

## Inspiration
Managing debt can be overwhelming, especially for those trying to stay on track with multiple payments. We wanted to create an easy-to-use tool that simplifies debt repayment, helping users visualize and stay motivated toward becoming debt-free.

## What it does
"What’s My Damage" calculates the monthly payment users need to make to be debt-free by a user specified goal date. It provides a progress bar and a graph showing how debt decreases over time, making financial planning clear and motivating.

## How we built it
We built the app using Firebase, Vite, and React for a fast, responsive, and scalable solution. Firebase handles user data and authentication, while React powers the user interface. Vite provided a speedy development experience, allowing us to iterate quickly.

## Challenges we ran into
We faced issues with all four team members working on GitHub simultaneously, which created conflicts and slowed down the development process. Additionally, integrating Firebase authentication and database functionality required careful handling to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of creating a functional and intuitive tool within a short timeframe. The app’s clean UI, smooth calculations, and visual representation of debt payoff offer a meaningful solution for users looking to manage their debt effectively.

## What we learned
We learned how to better integrate financial algorithms into a user-friendly interface, optimize calculations for user inputs, and use Firebase for user authentication and data management. We also improved our ability to work as a team, resolving GitHub conflicts along the way.

## What's next for What's my damage?
Next, we plan to add features such as custom notifications for payment reminders, integration with users' financial accounts, and more detailed financial insights. We also aim to expand the app to mobile platforms.
